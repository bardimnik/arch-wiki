Release: v1.0
Discription: Script used to pull up arch wiki pages quickly from the terminal.
Dependency: lynx OR elinks OR links


USEAGE:
The simplest way to use my script is to copy wiki.sh to your path. Copy the script
to ~/bin or /usr/local/bin. 

Note you will likely need sudo privelege to write to /usr/local/bin.
 
Also note when copying to path don't include the .sh extension,
this way the command you run will be wiki, not wiki.sh.

example:
sudo cp wiki.sh /usr/local/bin/wiki

Once you have copied the script to your path you can simply run wiki from anywhere
in the terminal. To search, simply enter your search following the wiki command.

wiki <search args here>

example:
wiki ssh
wiki lamp
wiki arch build system

This will pull your search from the arch wiki and display it in a terminal browser of your choice.

For help run:
wiki --help

Enjoy the wiki, and keep on learning.
